**Overview:**
LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI is a command line node app that takes in the following parameters and gives you back data from the Bands in Town, Spotify, and OMDB API.

    Try using the following commands: 
        * concert-this
        * spotify-this-song
        * movie-this
        * do-what-it-says
